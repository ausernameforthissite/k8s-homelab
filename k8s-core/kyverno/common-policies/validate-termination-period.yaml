        When terminationGracePeriodSeconds is zero, pod always uses forced deletion,
        which prevents release of resources used by pod:
        container is not stopped, volumes are not unmounted, custom resources are not release, shutdown hooks are skipped, etc.
        This can result in various race conditions. For pods with stable names multiple versions of the pod will exist.
        Use terminationGracePeriodSeconds=1 when you need quick deletion but want to avoid race conditions and bugs.
      pattern:
        spec:
          terminationGracePeriodSeconds: '>0'
