## Kubernetes Version Override allows forcibly overriding the detected KubeVersion for fallback capabilities assessment.
## The fallback capabilities assessment only occurs if the APIVersions Capabilities list does not include a known
## APIVersion for a manifest which occurs with some CI/CD tooling. This value will completely override the value
## detected by helm.
kubeVersionOverride: ''

## Kubernetes DNS Domain Override allows forcibly overriding the default DNS Domain for Kubernetes 'cluster.local'.
