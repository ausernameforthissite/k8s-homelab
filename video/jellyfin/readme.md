Jellyfin expects a specific file/folder layout for the media files.
It's unlikely that you already have it,
and some other programs that you use may require a different layout.

So in this deployment we create a separate folder
in which you can place symlinks to your real files, which are mounted to `/raw-data/`.
This way you can completely redefine folder layout without touching the original files.

```bash
kl -n jellyfin exec deployments/jellyfin -it -- bash
# ln -s /path/to/file /path/to/symlink
ln -s /raw-data/video/ /media/video
```

# Enable hardware transcoding

By default hardware decoding and encoding is disabled.

You can go to `Dashboard` -> `Playback` to enable it.

VAAPI is a semi-universal API supported by both AMD and Intel but not by NVidia.

# Hardware acceleration on Intel GPUs

Prerequisites:
- [Intel device plugin](../../hardware/intel-device-plugin/readme.md)

Checking hardware capabilities (run on host):

```bash
sudo cat /sys/kernel/debug/dri/0/gt0/uc/guc_info
sudo cat /sys/kernel/debug/dri/0/gt0/uc/huc_info
```

# Hardware acceleration on NVidia GPUs

Prerequisites:
- [NVidia device plugin](../../hardware/nvidia-device-plugin/readme.md)

# Proper database support

Jellyfin uses SQLite and doesn't support remote databases.

But the support is coming soonâ„¢ (for about 3 years at the moment).
