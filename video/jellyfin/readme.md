# Storage setup

# Deploy

```bash
kl create ns jellyfin

kl apply -k ./video/jellyfin/pvc/
kl -n jellyfin get pvc

# setup wildcard ingress
kl label ns --overwrite jellyfin copy-wild-cert=main
kl apply -k ./video/jellyfin/ingress-wildcard/
kl -n jellyfin get ingress

# choose one:
#   generic doesn't have hardware acceleration
kl apply -k ./video/jellyfin/generic/
#   for intel GPUs
kl apply -k ./video/jellyfin/intel/
#   for nvidia GPUs
kl apply -k ./video/jellyfin/nvidia/

kl -n jellyfin get pod -o wide
```

# Cleanup

```bash
kl delete -k ./video/jellyfin/generic/
kl delete -k ./video/jellyfin/pvc/
kl delete ns jellyfin

# Enable hardware transcoding

By default hardware decoding and encoding is disabled.

You can go to `Dashboard` -> `Playback` to enable it.

VAAPI is a semi-universal API supported by both AMD and Intel but not by NVidia.

# Hardware acceleration on Intel GPUs

Prerequisites:
- [Intel device plugin](../../hardware/intel-device-plugin/readme.md)

Checking hardware capabilities (run on host):

```bash
sudo cat /sys/kernel/debug/dri/0/gt0/uc/guc_info
sudo cat /sys/kernel/debug/dri/0/gt0/uc/huc_info
```

# Hardware acceleration on NVidia GPUs

Prerequisites:
- [NVidia device plugin](../../hardware/nvidia-device-plugin/readme.md)

# Proper database support

Jellyfin uses SQLite and doesn't support remote databases.

But the support is coming soonâ„¢ (for about 3 years at the moment).
