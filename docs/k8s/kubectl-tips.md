# Delete failed pods

During graceful shutdown k8s likes to create a myriad of pods in a `Failed` state,
that couldn't run because the node was shutting down. Duh.

These pods remain in the list even after cluster has rebooted and all working pods are scheduled.

```bash
# show pods
kl get pods --field-selector status.phase=Failed --all-namespaces
kl get pods --field-selector status.phase=Succeeded --all-namespaces

# delete pods
kl delete pods --field-selector status.phase=Failed --all-namespaces
kl delete pods --field-selector status.phase=Succeeded --all-namespaces
```

# Show pods from a certain node

```bash
kl get pod -A --field-selector spec.nodeName=n100.k8s.lan
```

# Re-initialize CNI on the node

One time I [gracefully!] rebooted all nodes in my cluster,
and after the reboot there was no cluster connectivity for unknown reason.

Rebooting the nodes did nothing.

Deleting CNI pods did nothing.

The easy way to solve this is to completely re-initialize CNI on the node.

Run on the node with network issues:

```bash
sudo rm -rf /etc/cni/ && sudo reboot
```
