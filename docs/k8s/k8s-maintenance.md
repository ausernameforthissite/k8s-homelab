# Delete failed pods

During graceful shutdown k8s likes to create a myriad of pods in a `Failed` state,
that couldn't run because the node was shutting down. Duh.

These pods remain in the list even after cluster has rebooted and all working pods are scheduled.

```bash
# show pods
kl get pods --field-selector status.phase=Failed --all-namespaces
kl get pods --field-selector status.phase=Succeeded --all-namespaces

# delete pods
kl delete pods --field-selector status.phase=Failed --all-namespaces
kl delete pods --field-selector status.phase=Succeeded --all-namespaces
```

# Remove node from cluster

```bash
kl drain n100.k8s.lan --ignore-daemonsets --delete-emptydir-data
kl delete node n100.k8s.lan
```

Then ssh into the removed node and disable kubelet:

```bash
sudo kubeadm reset --force
```
