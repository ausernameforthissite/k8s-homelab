Installation was tested on Orange Pi Zero 2w and Orange Pi Zero 3 with Debian 12 on 6.1.31 kernel.

For Orange Pi Zero 2w I had to disable `fix-nfs-msd` in the script
and manually replace `gpiod.LineEvent` in python code.
Later for Orange Pi Zero 3 I didn't need to do anything,
so maybe it got patched in the repo.

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt full-upgrade -y

sudo apt install -y git make python3-dev gcc xz-utils wget
git clone https://github.com/srepac/kvmd-armbian.git --depth 1
# this will take several minutes
( cd kvmd-armbian && sudo ./install.sh )
# at the end of the script press ENTER when prompted
# the system will reboot

# run install once again after reboot
( cd kvmd-armbian && sudo ./install.sh )
# it will run `kvmd -m` which should spit out a bunch of yaml configs
# enter 'y' if it did
# read errors and fix them if there were errors instead of yaml

curl --insecure https://localhost/login/

# optionally, set up users
# set password for username, create user if needed
sudo kvmd-htpasswd set username
# delete user
sudo kvmd-htpasswd del username
# enable 2FA auth
# the secret is the same for all users
sudo kvmd-totp init
# print secret QR code
sudo kvmd-totp show
# reboot is required for kvmd to pick up 2fa settings
sudo reboot
```

Default credentials are:
- Username: `admin`
- Password: `admin`

# Drive mounts / MSD

This enables you to mount ISOs via emulated CD-ROM or Flash drive.
You may need to disconnect storage USB device to properly switch between CD-ROM and Flash.

```bash
chmod +x ./kvmd-armbian/create-flash-msd.sh ./kvmd-armbian/apply-msd-patch.sh
sudo mkdir /kvmd-storage/
# this creates a 16 GB file that will be mounted as storage partition
# total size of ISO and IMG files will be limited by this partition size
sudo ./kvmd-armbian/create-flash-msd.sh -n image -s 16 -d /kvmd-storage

sudo tee << EOF /etc/kvmd/override.d/1-enable-msd.yaml
kvmd:
  msd:
    type: otg
EOF
# it seems like kvmd updates the list of required kernel modules only on reboot
sudo reboot now

# Â¿ optional ?
sudo ./kvmd-armbian/apply-msd-patch.sh -f
```

# Writable Flash drive

You can mount any `.img` file as a writable flash device.
Here we create a small empty image.

Note, that if you want to get files from this image,
you will have to download the whole image,
so you probably want to keep it small.

```bash
sudo kvmd-helper-otgmsd-remount rw
# in megabytes
size=512
sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/var/lib/kvmd/msd/flash.img bs=1M count=$size status=progress
sudo chmod 666 /var/lib/kvmd/msd/flash.img
sudo kvmd-helper-otgmsd-remount ro
```

# Device switches

This adds switches in the GPIO section that allow you
to forcefully disconnect emulated USB devices.

```bash
# kvmd-otgconf --make-gpio-config
# make sure that all your devices from kvmd-otgconf are listed here

# USB relays

USB HID relays can be used to trigger buttons, like the power button of a PC.

Software to use them:
- https://github.com/darrylb123/usbrelay

Version in the Debian repo is old and doesn't support new devices,
so you are better off building it from source.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/darrylb123/usbrelay.git --depth 1
cd usbrelay

sudo apt install -y libhidapi-dev
make
sudo make install

sudo usermod -a -G plugdev $USER
sed -e 's/usbrelay/plugdev/' 50-usbrelay.rules | sudo tee /etc/udev/rules.d/50-usbrelay.rules
sudo udevadm control -R
# also reconnect to ssh at this point to apply the new user group

ls -la /dev/hidraw* /dev/usbrelay*
```

Usage example:

```bash
# without args prints all available pins
usbrelay
# PSUIS_1=1
# PSUIS_2=0

# set pin like this
usbrelay PSUIS_1=0

# here id of the relay couldn\t be read, so it's just _1 instead of SOMEPREFIX_1
usbrelay
# _1=0
# _2=0

# you can set pins via this short name
usbrelay _1=0
# you can also use the device path
usbrelay /dev/hidraw0_1=0
usbrelay /dev/usbrelay5-1_1=0
```

# Set up access to USB relay from the UI

```bash
sudo usermod -a -G plugdev kvmd

# select a relay to use
# note that /dev/usbrelay* is a physical device path
# that wiil change if you plug the device into a different USB port
ls -la /dev/usbrelay*
relay=
# example: relay=/dev/usbrelay5-1

# create the script that will actually switch the relay
# you will likely need to change /dev/usbrelay5-1_1 to your own path
sudo mkdir -p /etc/kvmd/scripts/
sudo tee << EOF /etc/kvmd/scripts/usb-relay-press.sh
#!/bin/bash
set -e

# check device list in case this script stopped working
# ls -la /dev/usbrelay*

delay=\$1
usbrelay -q ${relay}_1=1
sleep \$delay
usbrelay -q ${relay}_1=0
