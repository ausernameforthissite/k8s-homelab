  #     How this works:
  # We need to access the same endpoint (pve-exporter.pve-exporter.svc) to get metrics from each node
  # but for each node we need to set the real node address via HTTP param 'target'.
  # This way we can get many metrics from a single endpoint.
  # Prometheus doesn't support this natively.
  # It expects that each endpoint will use the same address with the same params
  # and will only serve its own metrics.
  # This is the opposite of what we need.
  # So we use relabelings aka relabel_configs to switch target address and set HTTP param 'target' using a meta-label '__param_target'.
  # And also we set the instance name using the proper target address.
  relabelings:
  - targetLabel: cluster_type
    action: replace
    replacement: pve
  - targetLabel: __param_target
    action: replace
    sourceLabels: [ __address__ ]
  - targetLabel: instance
    action: replace
    replacement: cluster
  - targetLabel: __address__
    action: replace
    replacement: pve-exporter.pve-exporter.svc:9221
